# Day Planner App

## Introduction
Get hands-on and learn how to build and deploy Nodejs application as `Azure App Service` with `AzureDB for PostgreSQL` Database Service and `Azure Search Service` using ARM template as deployment strategy.


## App Overview

Day Planner App is a sample Nodejs application that can be used to manage your day-to-day engagements. The app marks engagements, displays routes between them and showcases the distance and time required to reach the next engagement. 
The engagements are stored and retrieved from the __AzureDB for PostgreSQL__ database service using its geospatial capabilities. Depending on the date and start time of the engagement all engagements get arranged. 
The app also helps to search the near-by coffee shops to engagements by selecting the range as distance, using __Azure Search Service__ and its geospatial queries.

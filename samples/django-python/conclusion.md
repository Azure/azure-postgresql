### Conclusion
In a relatively short amount of time, we were able to git clone an app running on the Python Django framework, using a PostgreSQL database in the backend. 

We changed the connection string to a provisioned **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**, and then connected the Bootcamp application in Azure. 

When we ran the application and registered a username for ""Bootcamp, we were able to see that the username existed in our **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**. 

With this simple installation, you can utilize many tools for PostgreSQL such as PostGIS, PGAdmin, pgScale, etc.
